## 1. Use an if-else statement to compare the user's age with the Required_Age
## a. If the input is greater than or equal to 18, display ' Welcome $NAME, you are allowed;
## b. otherwise, display ' Sorry $NAME, you are not allowed.
(taking back the previous script on bash-day2-assignment and then do the if condition on it)

if [ "$AGE" -ge "$Required_Age" ]; then

    echo "Welcome $NAME, you are allowed."
    
else

    echo "Sorry $NAME, you are not allowed."
    
fi
